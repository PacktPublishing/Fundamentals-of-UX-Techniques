## About the Video Course
User Experience (UX) design is a theoretical understanding of how users interact with websites. It is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in interacting with the product. Everything humans interact with, has an experience associated with it. Some are good, some are bad, but only recently have we begun to consciously design these experiences. We are now at the point when experience-design has suddenly exploded into the consciousness of business people and ordinary people all over the world. A poor user experience leads to losing customers and in turn the company loses money.

You will start your journey by looking at how to set up your UX design process and defining the set steps and interactions a user is engaging in. Here you will learn ideation and sketching and explore business needs, idea grouping, and idea generation. Then youâ€™ll understand some rules around the technology, its Interaction types, UI Sketching, explore UI patters and finally review and iterate on your own sketches. Taking these sketches ahead, learn to build on them by creating a low-fidelity prototype. Explore the need for using these prototypes and Invision App, connecting prototypes via Invision App, and sharing.

Finally, weâ€™ll monitor and review some of the feedback received from our users by using and deploying Invision App.
